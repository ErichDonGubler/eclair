# Output format desciprtion

`eclair` formats the summary data in a binary MessagePack format. MessagePack is a binary equivalent of JSON. It has serialization and deserialization libraries available in a wide variety of languages.MessagePack

The MessagePack layout generated by `eclair` looks like this:

```
[
  [1, 3, 2005],
  [
    ['TIME',  'DAYS',  ['Timing'],       [<Array of floats>]],
    ['YEARS', 'YEARS', ['Timing'],       [<Array of floats>]],
    ['FGIP',  'MSCF',  ['Field'],        [<Array of floats>]],
    ['WWCT',  '',      ['Well', 'I1'],   [<Array of floats>]],
    ['BPR',   'PSIA',  ['Cell', 120910], [<Array of floats>]],
    ...
  ]
],
```

The first triplet of integers denotes the simulation start date. It is followed by an array of individual vector records, each containing the following fields:

- Vector name;
- Physical units;
- Identifier array, which describes what type of data the vector contains;
- Vector data;
